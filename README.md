# Embedding: Study how a LLM (Large Language Model) works via its embeddings

## 2024-01-23: update

I have added a "txt2vid" button, this is
somewhat beta/POC level but you can enter
some text and it will generate an MP4 with a frame per
character. You will need to have ffmpeg installed for
this to work (apt install ffmpeg, yum install ffmpeg).
Generation runs in the background, you should get pop-up
messages about the task progressing.
It will take a few minutes depending on the input size.

## Introduction

It is possible to get a dump of the hyper-dimensional "brain" of an LLM. As of this document, OpenAI offers that via the API and for Ollama likewise features an "/api/embeddings" endpoint.

Embeddings in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs) are high-dimensional vectors that encapsulate the nuanced understanding of textual input. When an LLM processes a piece of text, it translates this text into a mathematical form - the embedding. Each element of this vector represents a specific feature or aspect of the input text, captured in a multi-dimensional space.

These embeddings are not just arbitrary numbers; they are structured and meaningful representations. They encode various linguistic and semantic attributes, like the meaning of words, their context, and the syntactical relationships between them. The high dimensionality allows for a rich and complex representation, capable of capturing the subtleties and intricacies of language.

In essence, embeddings are the LLM's interpretation of text transformed into a numerical space. This transformation is key to how the model processes, understands, and generates language-based responses. Analyzing these embeddings provides deep insights into the inner workings of the model, revealing how it perceives and processes linguistic input.

## Conceptualization: Visual Representation of Embeddings

### The Premise

The core idea revolves around converting the numerical data from embeddings into a visual format. Given the immense proficiency of the human brain in visual processing, this approach aims to leverage our inherent ability to discern patterns and anomalies in visual data.

### The Process

#### Data Conversion:

Transform each element of the embedding vector (typically in the range of 2560 to 4096 dimensions) into a pixel value in an image.

#### Image Generation:

Construct an image where each pixel corresponds to a dimension of the embedding, allowing the vector to be visually represented.

### The Rationale

#### Pattern Recognition:

The human brain excels at identifying patterns, trends, and irregularities in visual information. By translating embeddings into a visual medium, we can potentially uncover insights that might be less apparent in numerical or textual analysis.

#### Complex Data Simplification:

Converting high-dimensional data into images could simplify the complexity, making it more accessible for analysis and interpretation.

#### Intuitive Analysis:

Visual representations might reveal structural or relational aspects of the embeddings that are not immediately evident in the raw numerical data.

### Potential Challenges

#### Dimensional Representation:

Accurately representing such high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional image without losing critical information.

#### Color and Scale Interpretation:

Deciding on the color scale and range that accurately reflects the magnitude and nature of the embedding dimensions.

### Applications

#### Model Debugging and Optimization:

Visual analysis could help identify anomalies or biases in how the model processes text.

#### Comparative Studies:

By visualizing embeddings from different texts or models, we can compare and contrast how different inputs or architectures influence the embeddings.

## Conclusion

This innovative approach could offer a new dimension in understanding and analyzing LLM embeddings. By tapping into our visual processing capabilities, we might unlock new perspectives in the interpretability and functionality of these complex models.

## About the source

The main class is here (Embeddings.java).
You will also have to install Ollama [https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) and my Jllama project [https://github.com/Walter-Stroebel/Jllama](https://github.com/Walter-Stroebel/Jllama).

Obviously you will also need a Java 11 or better JDK like OpenJDK.
